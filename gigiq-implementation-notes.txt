# Every minute
Phone -> Hearbeat -> Server
Phone <- Ranked Requests <- Server

# Rank Requests in the following way
Filter requests by time
First narrow requests by location (mongodb GeoHash)
Rank jobs in terms of $/min
	Value =  (Reward - Cost) / Time
? Use distance from "homebase" as part of cost. Not quite sure how right now. 
? look at trends in traffic over time to determine distance from dropoff location to next pickup location

# Accepting a request
Phone -> Accept Request with ID -> Server
1. Phone <- Request already accpted <- Server
2. Phone <- Cannot reach server <- ?
3. Phone <- Request granted <- Server

# Request Generation
Randomize latlong based on center and radius
- Pickup
- Dropoff
Randomize service
Random wait times between generation

# Accept Request from Third Party
{
	service,
	pickup,
	dropoff,
}
